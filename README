This chapter talks about scattering of tsunami wave by Koko Guoyt. And describes the following:
1) Energy flux approach to description of two tsunami events
	a) Difference between Kuril and Tohoku events
	b) Different energetics at Crescent City

2) Koko guoyt scattering as generation of tsunami beams
	a) analytical solution
	b) dependence of scattered signal on frequency and incidence
3) Ray tracing
	a) of the incident wave
	b) of scattered waves
4) Predictions
